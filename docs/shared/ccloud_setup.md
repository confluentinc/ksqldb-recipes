Setup your environment in [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ksqldb_recipes), a fully-managed Apache KafkaÂ® service, and within your environment create a [ksqlDB](https://ksqldb.io/) application.

ksqlDB supports a `SQL` language for processing the data in real-time (and will soon support connector integration for reading and writing data to other data sources and sinks). Execute the recipe with the provided `SQL` commands using the Confluent Cloud ksqlDB editor.
