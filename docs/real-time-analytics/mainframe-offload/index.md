# Modernize Mainframes for Real-Time

From order processing to financial transactions, inventory control to payroll, mainframes continue to support many mission-critical applications by continuing to perform the majority of batch processing for many enterprises.
Data-driven enterprises need real-time access to mainframe data to feed distributed applications, microservices and other business operations, and to enable organizations to use all their data for competitive advantage.
Confluent enables you to combine data from mainframes with real-time data across the rest of your organization to increase the benefits of both.

- Offload with Apache Kafka to keep a more modern data-store in real-time sync with the mainframe
- Reduce overall operational expenses including Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS) costs, while providing a path for architectural modernization
- Enable event-driven microservices and deliver to other systems such as data warehouses and search indexes

## Step by step

### Set up your environment

Provision a Kafka cluster in [Confluent Cloud](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-cloud/tryfree/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=ksqldb_recipes&utm_campaign=mainframe_offload).

### Read the data in

--8<-- "docs/shared/connect.md"

```json
--8<-- "docs/real-time-analytics/mainframe-offload/source.json"
```

--8<-- "docs/shared/manual_insert.md"

### ksqlDB code

This code creates a real-time cache in ksqlDB of mainframe account data, which can be used to offload mainframe calls to Kafka.
