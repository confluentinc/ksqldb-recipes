# Real-Time Delivery Logistics

In today's world, last-mile delivery services are crucial. These operations have to operate as smoothly as possible, ensuring that customers are receiving their orders on time and that they are, ideally, provided real-time updates as the process takes place. This recipe will show your delivery service how to compute delivery estimates and status updates in real-time.

## Step-by-step

### Read the data in

For this recipe, we'll be using order data as well as a stream of status updates from a fleet of delivery vehicles that are in the process of transporting orders from a warehouse to customers. Kafka Connect can easily stream in data from a database containing that information; use the following template as a guide for setting up your connector.

```json

### Run stream processing app

This application processes real-time vehicle information, showing the current state of the order on the vehicle –  `WAREHOUSE`, `EN ROUTE`, or `DELIVERED` – along with the distance away from the final destination and an estimated delivery time.
